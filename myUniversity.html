    <p class="w3-justify">The Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) is a public community college in New York City. Founded in 1963 as part of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, BMCC grants associate degrees in a wide variety of vocational, business, health, science, engineering and continuing education fields.

BMCC's original campus was scattered all over midtown Manhattan, utilizing office spaces, hotel conference rooms, and various spaces throughout Manhattan. In the mid-1970s, CUNY began scouting for suitable property on which to erect a new campus of its own. The current campus has been in use since 1983.

Currently, with an enrollment of over 27,000 students[2] the BMCC student body is nearly two-thirds female and has a median age of 24, with attending students hailing from over 100 different countries. The Center for Continuing Education and Workforce Development at BMCC serves more than 11,000 students who complete non-credit bearing and certificate programs in allied health, information technology and media arts, career training and personal development, English as a Second Language and other areas. Another 10,000 students are enrolled in distance education programs. BMCC has a faculty of nearly 1,000 full-time and adjunct professors.</p>
